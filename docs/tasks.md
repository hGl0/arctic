# Arctic Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the Arctic project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Documentation Improvements

1. [ ] Complete the README.md file with comprehensive usage instructions and examples
2. [ ] Add a detailed description of the project's purpose and scope to the README
3. [ ] Create a proper contributing guide with coding standards and pull request process
4. [ ] Add docstrings to all functions in utils.py that are currently missing them
5. [ ] Create a user guide with examples of common use cases
6. [ ] Add inline comments to complex algorithms for better code understanding
7. [ ] Create API documentation for all public functions and classes
8. [ ] Add a changelog file to track version changes

## Code Quality Improvements

9. [ ] Replace wildcard imports (e.g., `from .utils import *`) with explicit imports
10. [ ] Add proper type hints to all functions for better IDE support and code clarity
11. [ ] Convert debug print statements to proper logging
12. [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all functions
13. [ ] Add unit tests for all functions to ensure code reliability
14. [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing
15. [ ] Implement input validation for all public functions
16. [ ] Add parameter validation with descriptive error messages

## Architectural Improvements

17. [ ] Resolve circular import issues between computation.py and utils.py
18. [ ] Move the compute_ellipse function from computation.py to utils.py as suggested in the comment
19. [ ] Refactor the create_animation function to avoid nested function definitions
20. [ ] Implement a more modular structure with clearer separation of concerns
21. [ ] Create a proper package structure with setup.py for easy installation
22. [ ] Implement a configuration system for customizable default parameters
23. [ ] Separate data loading and preprocessing from analysis functions
24. [ ] Create a proper plugin system for extensibility

## Performance Improvements

25. [ ] Optimize the feature_consistence function to avoid repeated PCA computations
26. [ ] Implement caching for expensive computations
27. [ ] Parallelize computation-intensive operations where possible
28. [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
29. [ ] Implement lazy loading for large data files
30. [ ] Profile the code to identify and fix performance bottlenecks

## Feature Enhancements

31. [ ] Implement additional clustering algorithms beyond AgglomerativeClustering
32. [ ] Add support for interactive visualizations
33. [ ] Implement export functionality for all plot types
34. [ ] Add support for different data formats beyond CSV
35. [ ] Implement a command-line interface for batch processing
36. [ ] Add progress bars for long-running operations
37. [ ] Implement a caching system for intermediate results
38. [ ] Add support for cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)

## Bug Fixes
